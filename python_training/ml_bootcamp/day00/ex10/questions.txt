Exercise 10 - Question time!
Are you able to clearly and simply explain:

1 - Why do we concatenate a column of ones to the left of the x vector when we use the linear algebra trick?
	> Because that way we turn the x vector into a matrix that we can then multiply to the theta vector
	(since now they are compatible, as x is now (m * 2) & theta is (2 * 1) -> gives a (m * 1) vector)

2 - Why does the cost function square the distances between the data points and their predicted values?
	> Because if we don't, some values will be negative and when they will be compared to the predicted values
	they might end up producing a zero, thus losing the value. Squaring them up ensure every value is positive,
	so none can be lost by producing zero.

3 - What does the cost function's output represent?
	> It represents the accuracy of the model by outputting the variance between what was predicted and what was
	actually obtained.

4 - Toward which value do we want the cost function to tend? What would that mean?
	> We want it to tend toward zero. That would mean the loss is minimal, and the model is extremely accurate.

5 - Do you understand why are matrix multiplications are not commutative?
	> Because they wouldn't output the same results ! (Except for instance they're square matrices filled with ones.)
